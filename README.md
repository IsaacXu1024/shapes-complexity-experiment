# Transitive Properties of Complexity in Classification problems

The notebook contained here uses a toy dataset consisting of squares, circles, rectangles, and ellipses to conduct an experiment investigating the transitive properties of "complexity" in classification problems.

The expectation is that semantically similar shapes will be more difficult to tell apart, leading to a greater "complexity" in the classifcation problem. Using attained information from experimentation on how complex it is to tell every shape from every other shape, we may be able to predict the difficulty for tasks which we have not previously encountered.

Experiments ran using this code form the basis for the discussion in Chapter 3 of my MCSc thesis available at: https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/handle/10222/81773
